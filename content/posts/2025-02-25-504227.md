# 专门给儿童制作的编程语言KPL

**Kid's Programming Language**

**Introduction:**

* U.S. Computer Science enrollments have dropped by 2/3 the last few years, and shouldn’t
* We wanted to teach our own kids how to program
* We have fond memories of starting as programmers by coding games in BASIC
* Beginning programmers have been
  **forgotten**
  by the software industry for 20 years
* Specifically, VS.NET and Eclipse, the industry standard development environments, are NOT beginner environments
* Educational software could do much more for kids if it were easier to create, and with KPL it now
  **is**
  easier to create – even by teachers or parents who are not professional programmers
