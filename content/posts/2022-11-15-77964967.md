# python 2.7安装xgboost

I think it works for normal python, too.

If you use python 3.5:

1: download the package
[here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ "here")
, the version depends on your python version, python3.5 or python 3.6, 32bit or 64bit.

2: use the command window, use cd to make the download folder as your pwd, then use

```
pip install filename.whl
```

OK, finished. For more detailed steps, see
[this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39811079/5918696)

if you use python 2.7,
you do NOT need to download the VS2013 to build it yourself, because I have built it, you can download the file I built and install it directly

1: Download it
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6HXvVF1p1HWcTdwZ2dGYkVyZG8/view?usp=sharing)
http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nuEYP1B

2: Download it, decompress it, paste it here:

"your python path\Lib\site-packages"

Then you should have something look like this:

3: In python-package folder showed above, use cmd window, cd there and run

```
python setup.py install 
```

use this code

```
 import xgboost 
```

in your python to check whether you have installed mingw-64 or not, No error information means you have installed the mingw-64 and you are finished.

If there are error information

"WindowsError: [Error 126] "

That means you have not installed mingw-64, and you have one more step to go.

Download the mingw-64 here:
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/>

Choose x86\_64 instead of the default "i686" when you installed the mingw-64, then add "your install path\x86\_64-6.2.0-posix-seh-rt\_v5-rev1\mingw64\bin;" to your PATH, it should be something like this:

"C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86\_64-6.2.0-posix-seh-rt\_v5-rev1\mingw64\bin;"

(this is mine).

Don't forget the ";" in the PATH.

Then you are finished,you can use

```
import xgboost 
```

in your python to check that, Yeah!
