# Setup SSL/ HTTPS on NGINX on CentOS 8/ AlmaLinux 8/ RockyLinux 8

Installing SSL can usually be a very tedious process. Luckily for us, Certbot has an automated script to easily help us to get SSL/ HTTPS set up with a few command lines.

To start, install Certbot

sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
  
sudo dnf install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

Once Certbot is installed, automatically generate an SSL certificate by running this command. You will be prompted with several inputs to fill in.

certbot --nginx

[root@nginx ~]# certbot --nginx
  
[root@nginx ~]# certbot --nginx

Would you be willing, once your first certificate is successfully issued, to
  
share your email address with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a founding

develops Certbot? We'd like to send you email about our work encrypting the web,

These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
  
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.

[root@nginx ~]#

With these set up, your domain's SSL setup should be complete.

Note: Your browser might still cache the old self-signed certificate, or the certificate will not update, hence still showing insecure SSL. To fix this, try clearing your browser's cache or try accessing your website with a different browser.

To check SSL status, try using this
