     Installing SSL can usually be a very tedious process. Luckily for us, Certbot has an automated script to easily help us to get SSL/ HTTPS set up with a few command lines.
    </p>
    <p>
     To start, install Certbot
    </p>
    <p>
     sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
     <br/>
     sudo dnf install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Certbot is installed, automatically generate an SSL certificate by running this command. You will be prompted with several inputs to fill in.
    </p>
    <p>
     certbot --nginx
    </p>
    <p>
     [root@nginx ~]# certbot --nginx
     <br/>
     [root@nginx ~]# certbot --nginx
     <br/>

     This certificate expires on 2022-04-02.

     These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

    <p>
     With these set up, your domain's SSL setup should be complete.
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Note: Your browser might still cache the old self-signed certificate, or the certificate will not update, hence still showing insecure SSL. To fix this, try clearing your browser's cache or try accessing your website with a different browser.
