# python3.9安装,如何使用conda安装python3.9？

![]()

I'm trying to install python 3.9 in a conda enviroment. I tried creating a new conda env using the following command,

conda create --name myenv python=3.9

But I got an error saying package not found because python 3.9 is not yet released

So, I manually created a folder in envs folder and tried to list all envs. But I couldn't get the manually created new environment.

So, how do I install python 3.9 in a conda env with all functionalities like pip working?

解决方案

Update

Python 3.9 is now available in conda-forge.

As pointed out in the comments, python 3.9 is not yet there on any channels. So, it cannot be install yet via conda.

Instead, you can download the python 3.9 executable and install it.

Once the installation is done, a new executable will be created for python 3.9 and pip 3.9 will be created.

Python:

python3.7

python3.7-config

python3.7m

python3.7m-config

python3.9

python3.9-config

pip

pip

pip3

pip3.7

pip3.8

pip3.9

pipreqs

In order to install ipython for python 3.9,

pip3.9 install ipython
