# 英语面试常见问题

**1. Where were you born?**

I was born in Shanghai in 1978, a very beautiful city along the eastern coast.

**2. Where did you have your education?**

I graduated from Beijing University, with the major of Economics in 2000.

**3. Your working history?**

After my graduation, I joined Exxon Mobil, one of the top 3 oil companies in the world,

developing, producing and selling oil products around the globe. I started working as a

salesman, and 2 years later, I was promoted to the VIP Sales Manager in Shanghai area,

responsible for the sales of chemicals to corporate clients.

Then, for some reasons, I changed my job to another company, P&G, and took the

position of Marketing Manager in China. My responsibility is to build the brand, promote

sales, conduct marketing programs, and maintain public relations.

Last year, I made the decision to pursue a MBA degree. I did this because I felt more and

more desired to improve my management knowledge and abilities as my job becomes

increasingly challenging.

毕业后，我加入了埃克森美孚，世界三大石油公司之一，在全球范围内开发、生产

和销售石油产品。我从销售做起，

2

年后晋升为上海地区

VIP

销售经理，负责向企业客

户销售化学品。

然后，由于一些原因，我换了一份工作到另一家公司宝洁公司，在中国担任市场经

理的职位。我的职责是建立品牌，促进销售，进行市场推广，维护公共关系。

去年，我决定继续攻读

MBA

学位。我之所以这么做，是因为随着我的工作越来越

具有挑战性，我越来越渴望提高自己的管理知识和能力。

**4. Your personal hobbies?**

I like sports very much and football is my biggest favorite. It’s always great to get together

with my mates on weekends, and keep running around the ground for a few hours. It makes

me physically stronger and totally refreshed.

我非常喜欢运动，足球是我最大的爱好。周末和我的伙伴们聚在一起，在操场上跑上几

个小时总是很棒的。它使我的身体更强壮，完全恢复活力。

I like reading much. Not too many people today can really sit down and read a book for more

than 2 hours every day. But as I think, reading is a rewarding hobby, as it can make you

mentally smarter.

我很喜欢读书。现在没有多少人能每天坐下来读超过

2

个小时的书。但我认为，阅读是

一种有益的爱好，因为它可以让你更聪明。

I like travelling around. I enjoy talking to new people and get to know new customs and

places.

我喜欢到处旅游。我喜欢和新的人交谈，了解新的习俗和地方。

**5. Give me a summary of your current job description.**

**对你目前的工作**

**,**

**能否做个概括的说明。**

I have been working as a computer programmer for five years. To be specific,I do system

analysis

，

trouble shooting and provide software support.

我干了五年的电脑程序员。具体地说，我做系统分析，解决问题以及软件供应方面的支

持。

**6. Why did you leave your last job?**

**你为什么离职呢**

I am interested in a new challenge and want to use my skills and experience in a different

position than in the past.I left my last job to get better personal growth and career

development.

一份工作是为了获得更好的个人成长和职业发展。

I feel I have reached the "glass ceiling" in my current job and there is no opportunity for

advancement.To get better personal growth and career development,if opportunity knocks,I

will take it.

我觉得目前的工作，已经达到顶峰，即没有升迁机会。为了更好的个人成长和事业发展，

如果机会来临，我会抓住它。

**7. What is your greatest accomplishment in your past jobs?**

**过去工作中最大的成就是什么？**

Actually, my past work experience is a chain of failures and achievements!

Yet, talking about the biggest achievement, I think it was 2 years ago, when I was the

Manager of Logistic Department in an E-business Company, dangdang.com.

The problem facing the company at that time is that it was troubled with high operating cost

and low delivery efficiency. In order to make the situation better, I worked with my mates on

the Information System for half a year, and also brought forward our plans of how to better

our warehouses and deliveries.

The job was well done, and we successfully cut operating cost by 20%. It was because of this

that I was promoted to the Vice president of this company.

事实上，我过去的工作经历是一连串的失败和成就

!

然而，说到最大的成就，我想是在

2

年前，当时我在当当网电子商务公司做物流部门经

理。

当时公司面临的问题是运营成本高，配送效率低。为了改善这种情况，我和我的伙伴们

一起做了半年的信息系统的工作，也提出了我们如何改善仓库和配送的计划。

这项工作做得很好，我们成功地把运营成本降低了

20%

。也正是因为这样，我才被提升

为这家公司的副总裁。

becoming the senior manager in a consulting firm 5 years from now.

这是个私人问题，我不能保证这就是你想要的答案。我的目标是

5

年后成为一家咨询公

司的高级经理。

Future is unpredictable, but it’s never bad to have a plan, isn’t it?It’s my dream that I want to

run my own business after this MBA program. What exactly I want to do is that I will

probably open an e-business company all by myself. I think I’m doing the right thing at the

right time, since Internet economy is the most promising industry today, and more and more

people will flock to the internet to shop. To answer your question just now, I expect myself to

be the CEO of a private-owned e-business company 5 years later.

未来是不可预测的，但有计划也不坏，不是吗

?

我的梦想是在这个

MBA

项目结束后能够

自己创业。我真正想做的是，我可能会自己开一家电子商务公司。我认为我是在正确的

时间做正确的事，因为互联网经济是当今最有前途的行业，会有越来越多的人涌向互联

CEO

。

响我的效率，所以我正试图找到一个平衡点，将有限的时间投入到最有价值的部分。
